Enhanced Compass for Mazda Connect
=============

The Enhanced Compass Application for Mazda Connect is an replacement for the Compass application. It features the original information like Compass Rose, Latitude, Longitude and Altitude plus a moving map that can be extended with POI, potential traffic and simple routing.

The idea behind this project is to offer an alternative to the optional Navigation Software. Most of the time it is enough to have a moving map to successfully navigate to a destination or find a place.

This software is compatible with all Mazda's equipped with the Infotainment starting with version 27.x.

Note: Screen includes a prototype of the POI database which will be part of the next release.
